<p>Set permissions for a node to be written to the database.</p>
<p>When a node is saved, a module implementing hook_node_access_records() will
be asked if it is interested in the access permissions for a node. If it is
interested, it must respond with an array of permissions arrays for that
node.</p>
<p>Each permissions item in the array is an array with the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>'realm': The name of a realm that the module has defined in
hook_node_grants().
</li>
<li>'gid': A 'grant ID' from hook_node_grants().
</li>
<li>'grant_view': If set to TRUE a user that has been identified as a member
of this gid within this realm can view this node.
</li>
<li>'grant_update': If set to TRUE a user that has been identified as a member
of this gid within this realm can edit this node.
</li>
<li>'grant_delete': If set to TRUE a user that has been identified as a member
of this gid within this realm can delete this node.
</li>
<li>'priority': If multiple modules seek to set permissions on a node, the
realms that have the highest priority will win out, and realms with a lower
priority will not be written. If there is any doubt, it is best to
leave this 0.
</li>
</ul>
