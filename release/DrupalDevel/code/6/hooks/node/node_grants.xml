<p>Inform the node access system what permissions the user has.</p>
<p>This hook is for implementation by node access modules. In this hook,
the module grants a user different "grant IDs" within one or more
"realms". In hook_node_access_records(), the realms and grant IDs are
associated with permission to view, edit, and delete individual nodes.</p>
<p>The realms and grant IDs can be arbitrarily defined by your node access
module; it is common to use role IDs as grant IDs, but that is not
required. Your module could instead maintain its own list of users, where
each list has an ID. In that case, the return value of this hook would be
an array of the list IDs that this user is a member of.</p>
<p>A node access module may implement as many realms as necessary to
properly define the access privileges for the nodes.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$account</b> -- 
The user object whose grants are requested.</p>
<p><b>$op</b> -- 
The node operation to be performed, such as "view", "update", or "delete".</p>
