		<help><![CDATA[<h2>hook_install()</h2>

<p>Install the current version of the database schema, and any other setup tasks.</p>
<p>The hook will be called the first time a module is installed, and the
module's schema version will be set to the module's greatest numbered update
hook. Because of this, anytime a hook_update_N() is added to the module, this
function needs to be updated to reflect the current version of the database
schema.</p>
<p>See the Schema API documentation at http://drupal.org/node/146843 for
details on hook_schema, where a database tables are defined.</p>
<p>Note that functions declared in the module being installed are not yet
available. The implementation of hook_install() will need to explicitly load
the module before any declared functions may be invoked.</p>
<p>Anything added or modified in this function that can be removed during
uninstall should be removed with hook_uninstall().</p>
