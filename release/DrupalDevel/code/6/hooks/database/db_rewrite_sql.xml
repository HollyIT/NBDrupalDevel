		<help><![CDATA[<h2>hook_db_rewrite_sql($query, $primary_table, $primary_field, $args)</h2>

<p>Rewrite database queries, usually for access control.</p>
<p>Add JOIN and WHERE statements to queries and decide whether the primary_field
shall be made DISTINCT. For node objects, primary field is always called nid.
For taxonomy terms, it is tid and for vocabularies it is vid. For comments,
it is cid. Primary table is the table where the primary object (node, file,
term_node etc.) is.</p>
<p>You shall return an associative array. Possible keys are 'join', 'where' and
'distinct'. The value of 'distinct' shall be 1 if you want that the
primary_field made DISTINCT.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$query</b> -- 
Query to be rewritten.</p>
<p><b>$primary_table</b> -- 
Name or alias of the table which has the primary key field for this query.
Typical table names would be: {blocks}, {comments}, {forum}, {node},
{menu}, {term_data} or {vocabulary}. However, it is more common for
$primary_table to contain the usual table alias: b, c, f, n, m, t or v.</p>
<p><b>$primary_field</b> -- 
Name of the primary field.</p>
<p><b>$args</b> -- 
Array of additional arguments.</p>
