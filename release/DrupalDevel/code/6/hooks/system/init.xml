<p>Perform setup tasks. See also, hook_boot.</p>
<p>This hook is run at the beginning of the page request. It is typically
used to set up global parameters which are needed later in the request.
when this hook is called, all modules are already loaded in memory.</p>
<p>For example, this hook is a typical place for modules to add CSS or JS
that should be present on every page. This hook is not run on cached
pages - though CSS or JS added this way will be present on a cached page.</p>
