<p>Perform setup tasks. See also, hook_init.</p>
<p>This hook is run at the beginning of the page request. It is typically
used to set up global parameters which are needed later in the request.</p>
<p>Only use this hook if your code must run even for cached page views.This hook
is called before modules or most include files are loaded into memory.
It happens while Drupal is still in bootstrap mode.</p>
