		<help><![CDATA[<h2>hook_exit($destination = NULL)</h2>

<p>Perform cleanup tasks.</p>
<p>This hook is run at the end of each page request. It is often used for
page logging and printing out debugging information.</p>
<p>Only use this hook if your code must run even for cached page views.
If you have code which must run once on all non cached pages, use
hook_init instead. Thats the usual case. If you implement this hook
and see an error like 'Call to undefined function', it is likely that
you are depending on the presence of a module which has not been loaded yet.
It is not loaded because Drupal is still in bootstrap mode.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$destination</b> -- 
If this hook is invoked as part of a drupal_goto() call, then this argument
will be a fully-qualified URL that is the destination of the redirect.
Modules may use this to react appropriately; for example, nothing should
be output in this case, because PHP will then throw a "headers cannot be
modified" error when attempting the redirection.</p>
