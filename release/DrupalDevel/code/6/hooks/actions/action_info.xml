<p>Declare information about one or more Drupal actions.</p>
<p>Any module can define any number of Drupal actions. The trigger module is an
example of a module that uses actions. An action consists of two or three
parts: (1) an action definition (returned by this hook), (2) a function which
does the action (which by convention is named module + '_' + description of
what the function does + '_action'), and an optional form definition
function that defines a configuration form (which has the name of the action
with '_form' appended to it.)</p>
