		<help><![CDATA[<h2>hook_search_preprocess($text)</h2>

<p>Preprocess text for the search index.</p>
<p>This hook is called both for text added to the search index, as well as
the keywords users have submitted for searching.</p>
<p>This is required for example to allow Japanese or Chinese text to be
searched. As these languages do not use spaces, it needs to be split into
separate words before it can be indexed. There are various external
libraries for this.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$text</b> -- 
The text to split. This is a single piece of plain-text that was
extracted from between two HTML tags. Will not contain any HTML entities.</p>
