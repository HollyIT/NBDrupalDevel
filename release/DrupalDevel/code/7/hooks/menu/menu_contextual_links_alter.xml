		<help><![CDATA[<h2>hook_menu_contextual_links_alter(&$links, $router_item, $root_path)</h2>

<p>Alter contextual links before they are rendered.</p>
<p>This hook is invoked by menu_contextual_links(). The system-determined
contextual links are passed in by reference. Additional links may be added
or existing links can be altered.</p>
<p>Each contextual link must at least contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>title: The localized title of the link.
</li>
<li>href: The system path to link to.
</li>
<li>localized_options: An array of options to pass to url().
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$links</b> -- 
An associative array containing contextual links for the given $root_path,
as described above. The array keys are used to build CSS class names for
contextual links and must therefore be unique for each set of contextual
links.</p>
<p><b>$router_item</b> -- 
The menu router item belonging to the $root_path being requested.</p>
<p><b>$root_path</b> -- 
The (parent) path that has been requested to build contextual links for.
This is a normalized path, which means that an originally passed path of
'node/123' became 'node/%'.</p>
