<p>Alter the list of projects before fetching data and comparing versions.</p>
<p>Most modules will never need to implement this hook. It is for advanced
interaction with the update status module: mere mortals need not apply.
The primary use-case for this hook is to add projects to the list, for
example, to provide update status data on disabled modules and themes. A
contributed module might want to hide projects from the list, for example,
if there is a site-specific module that doesn't have any official releases,
that module could remove itself from this list to avoid "No available
releases found" warnings on the available updates report. In rare cases, a
module might want to alter the data associated with a project already in
the list.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$projects</b> -- 
Reference to an array of the projects installed on the system. This
includes all the metadata documented in the comments below for each
project (either module or theme) that is currently enabled. The array is
initially populated inside update_get_projects() with the help of
_update_process_info_list(), so look there for examples of how to
populate the array with real values.</p>
