<p>Allows modules to declare their own Forms API element types and specify their
default values.</p>
<p>This hook allows modules to declare their own form element types and to
specify their default values. The values returned by this hook will be
merged with the elements returned by hook_form() implementations and so
can return defaults for any Form APIs keys in addition to those explicitly
mentioned below.</p>
<p>Each of the form element types defined by this hook is assumed to have
a matching theme function, e.g. theme_elementtype(), which should be
registered with hook_theme() as normal.</p>
<p>For more information about custom element types see the explanation at
http://drupal.org/node/169815.</p>
