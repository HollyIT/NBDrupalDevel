		<help><![CDATA[<h2>hook_node_submit($node, $form, &$form_state)</h2>

<p>Act on a node after validated form values have been copied to it.</p>
<p>This hook is invoked when a node form is submitted with either the "Save" or
"Preview" button, after form values have been copied to the form state's node
object, but before the node is saved or previewed. It is a chance for modules
to adjust the node's properties from what they are simply after a copy from
$form_state['values']. This hook is intended for adjusting non-field-related
properties. See hook_field_attach_submit() for customizing field-related
properties.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$node</b> -- 
The node object being updated in response to a form submission.</p>
<p><b>$form</b> -- 
The form being used to edit the node.</p>
<p><b>$form_state</b> -- 
The form state array.</p>
