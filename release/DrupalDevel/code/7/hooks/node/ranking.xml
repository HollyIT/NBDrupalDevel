<p>Provide additional methods of scoring for core search results for nodes.</p>
<p>A node's search score is used to rank it among other nodes matched by the
search, with the highest-ranked nodes appearing first in the search listing.</p>
<p>For example, a module allowing users to vote on content could expose an
option to allow search results' rankings to be influenced by the average
voting score of a node.</p>
<p>All scoring mechanisms are provided as options to site administrators, and
may be tweaked based on individual sites or disabled altogether if they do
not make sense. Individual scoring mechanisms, if enabled, are assigned a
weight from 1 to 10. The weight represents the factor of magnification of
the ranking mechanism, with higher-weighted ranking mechanisms having more
influence. In order for the weight system to work, each scoring mechanism
must return a value between 0 and 1 for every node. That value is then
multiplied by the administrator-assigned weight for the ranking mechanism,
and then the weighted scores from all ranking mechanisms are added, which
brings about the same result as a weighted average.</p>
