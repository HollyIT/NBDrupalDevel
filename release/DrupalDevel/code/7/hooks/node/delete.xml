		<help><![CDATA[<h2>hook_delete($node)</h2>

<p>Respond to node deletion.</p>
<p>This hook is invoked only on the module that defines the node's content type
(use hook_node_delete() to respond to all node deletions).</p>
<p>This hook is invoked from node_delete_multiple() after the node has been
removed from the node table in the database, before hook_node_delete() is
invoked, and before field_attach_delete() is called.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$node</b> -- 
The node that is being deleted.</p>
