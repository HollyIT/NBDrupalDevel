<p>Define all blocks provided by the module.</p>
<p>This hook declares to Drupal what blocks are provided by your module and can
optionally specify initial block configuration settings.</p>
<p>In hook_block_info(), each block your module provides is given a unique
identifier referred to as "delta" (the array key in the return value). Delta
values only need to be unique within your module, and they are used in the
following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passed into the other block hooks in your module as an argument to
identify the block being configured or viewed.
</li>
<li>Used to construct the default HTML ID of "block-MODULE-DELTA" applied to
each block when it is rendered (which can then be used for CSS styling or
JavaScript programming).
</li>
<li>Used to define a theming template suggestion of block__MODULE__DELTA, for
advanced theming possibilities.
</li>
<li>Used by other modules to identify your block in hook_block_info_alter() and
other alter hooks.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The values of delta can be strings or numbers, but because of the uses above
it is preferable to use descriptive strings whenever possible, and only use a
numeric identifier if you have to (for instance if your module allows users
to create several similar blocks that you identify within your module code
with numeric IDs). The maximum length for delta values is 32 bytes.</p>
