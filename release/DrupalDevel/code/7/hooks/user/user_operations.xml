		<help><![CDATA[<h2>hook_user_operations()</h2>

<p>Add mass user operations.</p>
<p>This hook enables modules to inject custom operations into the mass operations
dropdown found at admin/people, by associating a callback function with
the operation, which is called when the form is submitted. The callback function
receives one initial argument, which is an array of the checked users.</p>
