<p>Declare triggers (events) for users to assign actions to.</p>
<p>This hook is used by the trigger module to create a list of triggers (events)
that users can assign actions to. Your module is responsible for detecting
that the events have occurred, calling trigger_get_assigned_actions() to find
out which actions the user has associated with your trigger, and then calling
actions_do() to fire off the actions.</p>
