<p>Provide module-based image styles for reuse throughout Drupal.</p>
<p>This hook allows your module to provide image styles. This may be useful if
you require images to fit within exact dimensions. Note that you should
attempt to re-use the default styles provided by Image module whenever
possible, rather than creating image styles that are specific to your module.
Image provides the styles "thumbnail", "medium", and "large".</p>
<p>You may use this hook to more easily manage your site's changes by moving
existing image styles from the database to a custom module. Note however that
moving image styles to code instead storing them in the database has a
negligible effect on performance, since custom image styles are loaded
from the database all at once. Even if all styles are pulled from modules,
Image module will still perform the same queries to check the database for
any custom styles.</p>
