<p>Respond to image style flushing.</p>
<p>This hook enables modules to take effect when a style is being flushed (all
images are being deleted from the server and regenerated). Any
module-specific caches that contain information related to the style should
be cleared using this hook. This hook is called whenever a style is updated,
deleted, or any effect associated with the style is update or deleted.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$style</b> -- 
The image style array that is being flushed.</p>
