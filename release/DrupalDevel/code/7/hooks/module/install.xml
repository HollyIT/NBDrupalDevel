<p>Perform setup tasks when the module is installed.</p>
<p>If the module implements hook_schema(), the database tables will
be created before this hook is fired.</p>
<p>This hook will only be called the first time a module is enabled or after it
is re-enabled after being uninstalled. The module's schema version will be
set to the module's greatest numbered update hook. Because of this, anytime a
hook_update_N() is added to the module, this function needs to be updated to
reflect the current version of the database schema.</p>
<p>See the Schema API documentation at
<a href="http://drupal.org/node/146843">http://drupal.org/node/146843</a>
for details on hook_schema and how database tables are defined.</p>
<p>Note that since this function is called from a full bootstrap, all functions
(including those in modules enabled by the current page request) are
available when this hook is called. Use cases could be displaying a user
message, or calling a module function necessary for initial setup, etc.</p>
<p>Please be sure that anything added or modified in this function that can
be removed during uninstall should be removed with hook_uninstall().</p>
