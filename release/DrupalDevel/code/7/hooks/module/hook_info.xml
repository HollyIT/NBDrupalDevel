<p>Defines one or more hooks that are exposed by a module.</p>
<p>Normally hooks do not need to be explicitly defined. However, by declaring a
hook explicitly, a module may define a "group" for it. Modules that implement
a hook may then place their implementation in either $module.module or in
$module.$group.inc. If the hook is located in $module.$group.inc, then that
file will be automatically loaded when needed.
In general, hooks that are rarely invoked and/or are very large should be
placed in a separate include file, while hooks that are very short or very
frequently called should be left in the main module file so that they are
always available.</p>
