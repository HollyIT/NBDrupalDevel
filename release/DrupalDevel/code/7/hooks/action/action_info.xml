<p>Declares information about actions.</p>
<p>Any module can define actions, and then call actions_do() to make those
actions happen in response to events. The trigger module provides a user
interface for associating actions with module-defined triggers, and it makes
sure the core triggers fire off actions when their events happen.</p>
<p>An action consists of two or three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>an action definition (returned by this hook)
</li>
<li>a function which performs the action (which by convention is named
MODULE_description-of-function_action)
</li>
<li>an optional form definition function that defines a configuration form
(which has the name of the action function with '_form' appended to it.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>The action function takes two to four arguments, which come from the input
arguments to actions_do().</p>
