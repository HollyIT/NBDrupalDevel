<p>Perform setup tasks. See also, hook_boot.</p>
<p>This hook is run at the beginning of the page request. It is typically
used to set up global parameters which are needed later in the request.
when this hook is called, all modules are already loaded in memory.</p>
<p>This hook is not run on cached pages.</p>
<p>To add CSS or JS that should be present on all pages, modules should not
implement this hook, but declare these files in their .info file.</p>
