		<help><![CDATA[<h2>hook_aggregator_process($feed)</h2>

<p>Implement this hook to create a processor for aggregator module.</p>
<p>A processor acts on parsed feed data. Active processors are called at the
third and last of the aggregation stages: data is downloaded by the active
fetcher, it is converted to a common format by the active parser and
finally, it is passed to all active processors which manipulate or store the
data.</p>
<p>Modules that define this hook can be activated as processor on
admin/config/services/aggregator.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$feed</b> -- 
The $feed object that describes the resource to be processed. $feed->items
contains an array of feed items downloaded and parsed at the parsing
stage. See hook_aggregator_parse() for the basic format of a single item
in the $feed->items array. For the exact format refer to the particular
parser in use.</p>
