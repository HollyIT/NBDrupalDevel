<p>Implement this hook to expose the title and a short description of your
processor.</p>
<p>The title and the description provided are shown most importantly on
admin/config/services/aggregator. Use as title the natural name of the
processor and as description a brief (40 to 80 characters) explanation of
the functionality.</p>
<p>This hook is only called if your module implements
hook_aggregator_process(). If this hook is not implemented aggregator
will use your module's file name as title and there will be no description.</p>
