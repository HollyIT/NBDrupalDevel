<p>Implement this hook to create an alternative fetcher for aggregator module.</p>
<p>A fetcher downloads feed data to a Drupal site. The fetcher is called
at the first of the three aggregation stages: data is downloaded by the
active fetcher, it is converted to a common format by the active parser and
finally, it is passed to all active processors which manipulate or store the
data.</p>
<p>Modules that define this hook can be set as active fetcher on
admin/config/services/aggregator. Only one fetcher can be active at a time.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$feed</b> -- 
The $feed object that describes the resource to be downloaded.
$feed->url contains the link to the feed. Download the data at the URL
and expose it to other modules by attaching it to $feed->source_string.</p>
