<p>Implement this hook to expose the title and a short description of your
fetcher.</p>
<p>The title and the description provided are shown on
admin/config/services/aggregator among other places. Use as title the human
readable name of the fetcher and as description a brief (40 to 80 characters)
explanation of the fetcher's functionality.</p>
<p>This hook is only called if your module implements hook_aggregator_fetch().
If this hook is not implemented aggregator will use your module's file name
as title and there will be no description.</p>
