<p>Declare queues holding items that need to be run periodically.</p>
<p>While there can be only one hook_cron() process running at the same time,
there can be any number of processes defined here running. Because of
this, long running tasks are much better suited for this API. Items queued
in hook_cron() might be processed in the same cron run if there are not many
items in the queue, otherwise it might take several requests, which can be
run in parallel.</p>
