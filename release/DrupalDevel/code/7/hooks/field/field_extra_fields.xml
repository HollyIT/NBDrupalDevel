<p>Exposes "pseudo-field" components on fieldable entities.</p>
<p>Field UI's "Manage fields" and "Manage display" pages let users re-order
fields, but also non-field components. For nodes, these include the title,
poll choices, and other elements exposed by modules through hook_form() or
hook_form_alter().</p>
<p>Fieldable entities or modules that want to have their components supported
should expose them using this hook. The user-defined settings (weight,
visible) are automatically applied on rendered forms and displayed
entities in a #pre_render callback added by field_attach_form() and
field_attach_view().</p>
