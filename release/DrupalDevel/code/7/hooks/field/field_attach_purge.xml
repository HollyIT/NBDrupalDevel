<p>Act on field_purge_data().</p>
<p>This hook is invoked in field_purge_data() and allows modules to act on
purging data from a single field pseudo-entity. For example, if a module
relates data in the field with its own data, it may purge its own data
during this process as well.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>
$entity_type</b> -- 
The type of $entity; for example, 'node' or 'user'.</p>
<p><b>$entity</b> -- 
The pseudo-entity whose field data is being purged.</p>
<p><b>$field</b> -- 
The (possibly deleted) field whose data is being purged.</p>
<p><b>$instance</b> -- 
The deleted field instance whose data is being purged.</p>
