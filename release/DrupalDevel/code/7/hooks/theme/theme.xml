<p>Register a module (or theme's) theme implementations.</p>
<p>The following parameters are all optional.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
array $existing
An array of existing implementations that may be used for override
purposes. This is primarily useful for themes that may wish to examine
existing implementations to extract data (such as arguments) so that
it may properly register its own, higher priority implementations.</p>
<p><b>$type</b> -- 
Whether a theme, module, etc. is being processed. This is primarily useful
so that themes tell if they are the actual theme being called or a parent
theme. May be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>'module': A module is being checked for theme implementations.
</li>
<li>'base_theme_engine': A theme engine is being checked for a theme that is
a parent of the actual theme being used.
</li>
<li>'theme_engine': A theme engine is being checked for the actual theme
being used.
</li>
<li>'base_theme': A base theme is being checked for theme implementations.
</li>
<li>'theme': The actual theme in use is being checked.
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>$theme</b> -- 
The actual name of theme, module, etc. that is being being processed.</p>
<p><b>$path</b> -- 
The directory path of the theme or module, so that it doesn't need to be
looked up.</p>
