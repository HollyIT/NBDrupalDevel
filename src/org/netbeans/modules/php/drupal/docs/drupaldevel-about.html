<h2>About The Netbeans Drupal Development Tool</h2>
<p><img src="images/nddt.png" width="224" height="224" alt="NDDT"></p>
<p>The Netbeans Drupal Development Tool (NDDT) was developed to facilitate the development of Drupal modules and themes within the Netbeans IDE. This project us open sourced, licensees under the GPL public license (the same as Drupal!). The goal of this project is to become a group effort by Drupal developers to create a valuable item for our toolbox as we develop in our favorite platform.</p>
<p>The following shows a quick overview of the features currently offered in NDDT and updated information is always available <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
