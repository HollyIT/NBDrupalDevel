<h2>NDDT - Search Bar</h2>
<p><img src="../images/searchbar.jpg" width="312" height="64" alt="Search Bar"></p>
<p>The NDDT search bar is a toolbar item that appears on the top toolbar of Netbeans. The bar's function is very simple. Enter a hook, function or topic and press enter. Your browser will open to the appropriate page on api.drupal.org. The search bar detects which version of Drupal to search against based upon the currently active file in the editor. The search box will also autocomplete as you type against a list of items from api.drupal.org.</p>
