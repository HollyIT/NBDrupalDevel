<p><strong>Netbeans Drupal Development Tool (NDDT)</strong></p>

<p><em>NDDT now has its own website. Read news on upcoming releases and share code snippets</em></p>

<p><a href="http://nddt.hollyit.net/">http://nddt.hollyit.net/</a></p>

<h2>What is NDDT</h2>

<p>NDDT is a module for the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans IDE</a> that aides in the development of <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> module and
theme development. It provides rapid access to all the core Drupal hooks and theme override functions.</p>

<p>NDDT is powered by a custom templating system that allows for easy customization and addition
of new Drupal hooks and code snippets. View the Help section inside of NDDT for examples of
how you can quickly expand the functionality of this tool.</p>

<h2>Drush Integration</h2>

<p>Starting with version 2 <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a> is now a part of NDDT. Execute numerous Drush related commands
without ever having to leave your IDE. A custom Drush plugin is also utilized allowing you
to find all places where a certain hook is invoked.</p>

<p>The version 2 release of NDDT now has integration with <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a>. </p>

on-screen instructions and you are ready to go.</p>
